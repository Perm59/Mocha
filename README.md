# Project "Mocha and Chai"
Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai (NodeJS)

### Description
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Mocha/Chai to do unit tests in NodeJS. The core idea with unit testing is to test a function when giving it certain set of inputs.

Mocha and Chai are two JavaScript frameworks commonly used together for unit testing. Mocha is a testing framework that provides functions that are executed according in a specific order, and that logs their results to the terminal window. Chai is an assertion library that is often used alongside Mocha. It provides functions and methods that help you compare the output of a certain test with its expected value. 

### Setup
#### 1. Node
Your computer should have node and npm installed. Install the node.js LTS version from [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm gets installed along with node automatically).
You can use these commands to check the successful installation of node and npm.
npm -v // will return installed npm version
node -v // will return installed node version

#### 2. Mocha
Mocha is a JavaScript Test Framework that runs on Node.js and Browser.
Installation: npm install mocha

#### 3. Chai
Chai is BDD/TDD assertion library that can be paired with any javascript testing framework.
Assertion with Chai provides natural language assertions, expressive and readable style.
Installation: npm install chai
